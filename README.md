# PhotoManager

### 1. Introduction
> The role of a photo management application is to organize photographs so that they can
be easily accessed. In order to help organize photos, the user can provide tags to describe
the content of the photos. A tag is a keyword associated with a photo. For example, we
can associate the tag ”vacation” to any photo taken during a vacation. In Table 1, you
may find some examples of photos and the tags that are used to describe them.
